# Python File Manipulation Exercises

This repository contains three Python exercises focusing on file manipulation. Please follow the instructions below and ensure that you do not modify the existing code or add irrelevant comments to maintain clarity and readability.

## Exercise 1: Count Number of Lines in a File (number_lines.py)

Implement a Python script (`number_lines.py`) that counts the number of lines in a given file.

### Instructions:
- Use the provided `number_lines.py` file.
- The script should take a file name as input and print the number of lines in the file.


## Exercise 2: Invalid File Name Handling (egg.py)

Create a Python script (`egg.py`) that handles invalid file names gracefully.

### Instructions:
- Use the provided `egg.py` file.
- The script should take a file name as input.
- If the file exists, print the number of lines in the file.
- If the file does not exist, print "Na na Bo Bo doesn't exist."

## Exercise 3: Count Vowels in Lowercase String (count_vowels.py)

Write a Python script (`count_vowels.py`) to count vowels in a given lowercase string.

### Instructions:
- Use the provided `count_vowels.py` file.
- The script should take a string as input, convert it to lowercase, and then count the vowels.
- Print the count of vowels in the string.

## Important Note:

- Do not modify the existing code in the provided files (`number_lines.py`, `egg.py`, `count_vowels.py`).
- Avoid adding irrelevant comments or using ChatGpt or, as this may lead to a deduction in marks during the autograding process.

## Autograder Testing:

GitHub Autograders will be used to test your solutions. Ensure your implementations adhere to the given instructions and produce the expected outputs.

Good luck!
